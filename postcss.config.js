```javascript
// Folder Name: src
// File Name: tailwind.config.js

// This file is the configuration file for Tailwind CSS. It defines the settings and options for how Tailwind CSS will process your CSS.

// The `plugins` property is an array of plugins that you want to use with Tailwind CSS. In this case, we are using the `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` plugins.

// The `tailwindcss` plugin is the core plugin that provides all of the core features of Tailwind CSS.

// The `autoprefixer` plugin automatically adds vendor prefixes to your CSS. This ensures that your CSS will work in all major browsers.
